# Obsidian Haskell

This is a knowledge map about [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) powered by [Obsidian][].

This project was inspired by Kowainik's [Haskell Knowledge Map](https://kowainik.github.io/images/Haskell_Knowledge_Map.png). To get started, consider going to the [[Haskell]] page.

## Browsing

Go to <https://publish.obsidian.md/haskell>.

## Editing

Go to <https://github.com/tfausak/obsidian-haskell>. You can make changes directly through GitHub's web interface. If you'd like, you can clone the repo locally and make changes there. For the best experience, you should use [Obsidian][]'s desktop app, which is free and available for most major operating systems.
